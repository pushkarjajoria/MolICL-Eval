    You are an expert chemist evaluating blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. Given an input molecule, analyze the molecular structure from the SMILES string and provide if the molecule can penetrate the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB). 
    You have to return 1 or 0 where:
    - 1 indicates that the molecule has BBB penetration.
    - 0 indicates that the molecule does not have BBB penetration.
    Provide only the label without explanations. The answer should only contain a single number either 0 or 1.

    You are an expert chemist evaluating blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. Analyze the molecular structure from the SMILES string and provide if the given molecule can penetrate the Blood Brain Barrier using a single label of 0 and 1.
    For each molecule:
    - 1 indicates BBB penetration
    - 0 indicates no penetration
    Analyze the molecular structure from the SMILES string and examples below and provide if the given molecule can penetrate the Blood Brain Barrier.
    Provide only the label without explanations. The answer should only contain a single number either 0 or 1.
